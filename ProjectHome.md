## What is ExtLib? ##
ExtLib is a project aiming at providing a complete - yet small - standard library for the OCaml programming langage. The purpose of this library is to add new functions to OCaml Standard Library modules, to modify some functions in order to get better performances or more safety (tail-recursive) but also to provide new modules which should be useful for the average OCaml programmer.

ExtLib is not directly related to OCaml authors (INRIA) although this library can be seen as a proposal for inclusion in the official distribution.

## Status ##
The latest stable release of ExtLib is 1.5.1.  We're likely releasing only bug fix releases in the future.  We are committed to not break backwards compatibility with existing versions.

ExtLib was moved over to http://code.google.com in Dec 2007 to enable lower overhead releases and simpler collaboration.

See DeveloperPage for ExtLib developer documentation.

## License ##
ExtLib is released under the same license as the OCaml Standard Library (meaning: LGPL with linking exceptions).
